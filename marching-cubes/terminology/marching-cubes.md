# Marching Cubes

Marching Cubes is an algorithm that extracts a smooth mesh surface from [voxel.md](voxel.md "mention")s. It's part of a family of similar techniques called Isosurface Extraction, that form the technical basis of popular games including Deep Rock Galactic, Enshrouded, and indie hit "A Game About Digging A Hole".\

The average gamer is more familiar with its absence; the classic limitation that if the terrain can be modified, then it's almost certainly just a simple heightmap that does not allow for caves or tunnels or overhangs. Marching Cubes frees games from this limitation.
