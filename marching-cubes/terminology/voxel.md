# Voxel

Voxels get their name from being a variation of Pixel, but 3-Dimensional like a Volume. The most common type of Voxel is a Binary Voxel, which is simply Off/On, but that's not the type of Voxel we're using. We're using Density Voxels instead.

In context, Voxels are Density Voxels, that represent a 3-Dimensional Volume as a Density between 0 to 255. Our Voxels also have an index representing what type of material they are.&#x20;
