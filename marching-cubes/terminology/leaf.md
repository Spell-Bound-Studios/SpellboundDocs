# Leaf

A Leaf is any node of an [octree.md](octree.md "mention") that does not subdivide any further. \
\
A GeoForge Leaf is the gameobject in the Unity Hierarchy that the [octree.md](octree.md "mention") creates instead of subdividing. It's the gameobject with the mesh component that you actually see and collide with in game.&#x20;
