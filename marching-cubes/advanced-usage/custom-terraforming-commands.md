# Custom Terraforming Commands

A small Library of Terraforming Commands is provided by [geoforgestatic.md](../getting-started/beginner-guide/geoforgestatic.md "mention"), and a much larger Library of Commands is provided by [pro-version](../getting-started/pro-version/ "mention").\
\
However, if you want to implement your own custom commands, they must be compatible with the public method in[geoforgemanager](../getting-started/beginner-guide/geoforgemanager/ "mention"), ExecuteTerraform:

Refer to [geoforgestatic.md](../getting-started/beginner-guide/geoforgestatic.md "mention")and it's static helper class TerraformCommands for examples of how to write methods that suit the Func parameter.&#x20;
