# QuickStart

Import any one of Package's Samples, or if you would like to set up a brand new scene yourself, follow the instructions below.

1. Open a new scene or open the scene in which you want to try using GeoForge.&#x20;
2. Locate the Prefabs Folder and drag the [geoforgemanager](beginner-guide/geoforgemanager/ "mention") and the [simplevolume](beginner-guide/simplevolume/ "mention") Prefabs into the scene. These Prefabs should have all the required fields already assigned.
3. Move the main camera in the scene up to about y = 50 to ensure it's not inside the terrain that will be generated.
4. Locate the Scripts Folder and drag the script BasicWasdController onto the main camera. This script will let you fly the camera around like it's your character.
5. (OPTIONAL) RightClick Create > UI > Image, and set the transform as shown below. This places a simple square crosshair in the middle of your screen to visualize where digging and terraforming operations are aimed.
6. Enter Playmode and try digging and terraforming the terrain using keybinds 1, 2, and 3.
