# Pro Version

GeoForgePro is not intended to be a mandatory upgrade; the free version of GeoForge has all the core capabilities and performance built-in. Instead pro version provides a larger library of commands than [geoforgestatic.md](../beginner-guide/geoforgestatic.md "mention"), more [data-factory.md](../beginner-guide/simplevolume/data-factory.md "mention") options, and each of the [data-factory.md](../beginner-guide/simplevolume/data-factory.md "mention") is highly optimized for performant realtime procedural generation. It also provides a Sample for [infinite-terrain.md](infinite-terrain.md "mention").
