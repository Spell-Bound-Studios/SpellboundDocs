# Minimal Setup

Locate the Prefabs Folder and drag the "MarchingCubesManager" and the "SampleVolume" Prefabs into the scene. \
\
Locate the MainCamera in the scene and add the component "BasicWasdController" to it.

Optional - RightClick > UI > Image, and set the transform as shown below. This places a simple square crosshair in the middle of your screen to visualize where digging and terraforming operations are aimed.&#x20;

\
\
Now you're all set to fly around the scene and modify the SampleVolume with keybinds 1 (alpha1), 2, (alpha2) and 3 (alpha3), and see what you can tweak to fit into your project or inspire a new one.&#x20;
