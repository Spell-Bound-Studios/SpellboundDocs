# What is Marching Cubes?

Marching Cubes is an algorithm that extracts a smooth mesh surface from [voxel.md](../terminology/voxel.md "mention")s. It's part of a family of similar techniques called Isosurface Extraction, that form the technical basis of popular games including Deep Rock Galactic, Enshrouded, and indie hit "A Game About Digging A Hole".\

The average gamer is more familiar with its absence; the classic limitation of games that do not permit caves or overhangs in their terrain. Marching Cubes frees your game/project from that limitation. You can now implement caves and overhangs in a way that's compatible with procedural generation and/or destructible / terraformable terrain.
