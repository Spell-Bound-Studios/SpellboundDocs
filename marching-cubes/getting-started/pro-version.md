# Pro Version

Pro Version is not intended to be a mandatory upgrade; the free public package has all the capabilities and performance built-in. Instead pro version provides a library of assets and commands to conveniently satisfy more use-cases, with little or no coding needed. The assets are also written to maximize performance, instead of readability/accessibility as some assets in the free public package are written for.&#x20;
