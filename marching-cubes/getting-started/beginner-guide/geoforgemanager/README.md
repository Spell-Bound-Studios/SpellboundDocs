# GeoForgeManager

The GeoForgeManager is the Singleton that manages materials, object pooling and several other important back-end processes.\

As a user you only need to know to include it in the scene, and to assign its fields for [leaf-prefab.md](leaf-prefab.md "mention") and [voxel-material-database.md](voxel-material-database.md "mention").&#x20;
