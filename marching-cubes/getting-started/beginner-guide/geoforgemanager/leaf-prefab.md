# Leaf Prefab

The object that the [.](./ "mention")object pools. This is the object that will actually have the mesh on it. This prefab should have a MeshFilter, MeshRenderer with material assigned, and MeshCollider. It should also be assigned to the layer and tagged with the tag you want as default.&#x20;
