# Marching Cubes

Marching Cubes is an algorithm that extracts a smooth mesh surface from voxels. It's part of a family of similar techniques called Isosurface Extraction, who's members form the technical basis of popular games including Deep Rock Galactic, Enshrouded, and indie hit "A Game About Digging A Hole". Colloquially, game enthusiasts will know it as the thing that allows for runtime digging of caves and overhangs.\

Spellbound Marching Cubes is a powerful, performant, and flexible CPU implementation for Unity. Whether you want to create a huge open world with fully deformable terrain, or you want just a handful of discrete objects utilizing the algorithm, our package is made for that.<br>
