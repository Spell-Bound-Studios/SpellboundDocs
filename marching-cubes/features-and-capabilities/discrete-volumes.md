# Discrete Volumes

Some Marching Cubes implementations are locked to one all-encompassing world grid. This is fine for terrain, but we wanted more flexibility. \
\
We support multiple Marching Cubes "Volumes", each with its own size, resolution, voxel data, etc. They can be positioned, rotated, even at runtime. They can even be affixed with a Rigidbody and exposed to physics.&#x20;
