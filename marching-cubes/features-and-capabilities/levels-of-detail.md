# Levels of Detail

We've made our own [octree.md](../terminology/octree.md "mention") implementation of Eric Lenyel's "Transvoxel Algorithm", which stitches together Marching Cubes meshes of different size and level of detail seamlessly. This allows for large performant worlds, and/or high view distances.
